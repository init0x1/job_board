This error occurs because Composer is unable to verify SSL certificates while trying to download required files. The main causes for this issue are:

1- Outdated or Missing Certificate Authority (CA) File

  The CA bundle file (cacert.pem) may be outdated or missing.
Incorrect PHP Configuration (php.ini)

2- The openssl.cafile or curl.cainfo settings might not be correctly set.
XAMPPâ€™s OpenSSL Configuration Issue

If you are using XAMPP, it may have an outdated CA certificate bundle.
Steps to Fix the Issue
Method 1: Update the CA Certificates
Download the latest CA certificate bundle:

Go to https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem and download the file.
Save it in your PHP directory:

Place it in C:\xampp\php\extras\ssl\ or your PHP installation directory.
Update php.ini:

Open C:\xampp\php\php.ini in a text editor.
Search for these lines and update them:
ini
Copy code
curl.cainfo = "C:\xampp\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"
openssl.cafile = "C:\xampp\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"
Save the file and restart XAMPP.
Method 2: Ensure PHP is Using the Correct php.ini
Run the following command in CMD to check the active php.ini:
css
Copy code
php --ini
Verify that the php.ini file is the correct one (inside C:\xampp\php\).
Method 3: Manually Set the Certificate File for Composer
If the issue persists, try running the Composer installation with the following command in CMD:

arduino
Copy code
php -d curl.cainfo="C:\xampp\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem" composer-setup.php
After applying these fixes, try installing Composer again. Let me know if the issue persists! ðŸš€
